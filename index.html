		<h3>Health benefits of swimming</h3>
		<h4>Swimming is a great workout because you need to move your whole body against the resistance of the water.</h4>
		<h4>Swimming is a good all-round activity because it:</h4>
	    <ul> 
			<li>keeps your heart rate up but takes some of the impact stress off your body</li>
			<li>builds endurance, muscle strength and cardiovascular fitness</li>
			<li>helps maintain a healthy weight, healthy heart and lungs</li>
			<li>tones muscles and builds strength</li>
			<li>provides an all-over body workout, as nearly all of your muscles are used during swimming.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>The Different Swimming Strokes / Styles</h3>
		<h4>The Freestyle Stroke</h4>
		<p>The Freestyle Stroke or front crawl is often the preferred stroke of seasoned swimmers. It uses alternating arm movements with an above water recovery. The legs execute a flutter kick.</p>
		<h4>Breaststroke</h4>
		<p>Breaststroke is the most popular swim stroke of all. In breaststroke, both arms execute half-circular arm movements at the same time under water in front of the swimmer. The arm recovery also occurs under water. The legs simultaneously execute a whip kick.</p>
		<h4>Butterfly Stroke</h4>
		<p>The butterfly stroke stands out among the competitive strokes because of itâ€™s unique and spectacular technique. It uses a symmetrical arm stroke with an above water recovery. It also uses a wave-like body undulation and a dolphin kick.</p>
		<h4>Backstroke</h4>
		<p>As its name suggests, backstroke is swum on the back. It uses alternating circular arm movements and an above water recovery. The legs execute a flutter kick similar to the one used in freestyle.</p>
		<h4>Sidestroke</h4>
		<p>The sidestroke is an old swim stroke swum on the side that uses a scissor kick and asymmetrical under water arm movements.</p>
		<h4>Elementary Backstroke</h4>
		<p>Elementary backstroke is a swim stroke that is swum on the back, using a reversed breaststroke kick and a simple synchronous under water arm stroke.</p>
